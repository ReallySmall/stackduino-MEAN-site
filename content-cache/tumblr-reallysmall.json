Originally I got the lens but not the extender, which seems to happen a lot on ebay - but one finally came up last week and at long last I’m able to combine the two pieces! :)</p>\n<p>It’s not really an easy lens to use.</p>\n<ul><li>It weighs close to a kilo on its own</li>\n<li>Fully extended with the macro adapter it’s long and unwieldy</li>\n<li>It doesn’t have modern coatings so is susceptible to flare and contrast issues without a good hood or if pointed straight at a strong light source</li>\n<li>There’s no autofocus</li>\n</ul><p>Used correctly though its ability to resolve fine detail and render soft bokeh is well documented. Looking forward to trying it out on the tripod.

The slightest movement of the clouds or turning a few degrees and the lighting changes - the exposure settings you worked out are now wrong. It’s less of an issue if you illuminate the whole scene with flash, but black backgrounds are rarely as nice as a blend of ambient and flash.</span><br/><span> </span><br/><span>P-TTL (Pre-flash Through The Lens) is the automatic metering system which Pentax uses on its modern cameras. It creates an initial very quick (usually too quick for the eye to register) ‘pre-flash’ and the metering system uses the feedback from this together with information about the current camera and lens settings to calculate how much light the flash needs to put out for the exposure. The camera then takes the picture with these settings and, hopefully, you come out with a nice image.</span><br/><span> </span><br/><span>P-TTL isn’t perfect and it gets confused by high contrast or shiny objects, but you can use exposure compensation in these situations. I thought it might be useful for insect photography, so I could concentrate more on composition and less on trying to chimp my way to the right settings. While a lot of people swear by manual flash even for insects, I want to see how P-TTL will work out…it might be useless…or it might not..I might end up using a mixture of both.</span><br/><span> </span><br/><span>Both my macro lenses are manual models from the 80s, they offer great image quality but have no electronics in them at all. P-TTL relies on feedback from the lens such as its aperture and focal length in order to make exposure calculations. Officially, P-TTL only works with automatic lenses, it can’t be made to work with manual lenses. Except it can. </span><span>Sort of</span><span>.</span><br/><span> </span><br/><span>I carried out a couple of reversible modifications to try this out. None of these are new ideas at all, just new to me.</span><br/><span> </span><br/><span>Telling the camera a manual lens is an automatic lens</span><br/><span> </span><br/><span>The camera mounting ring has a slightly recessed connection.

Stacking is also not perfect, I didn’t go far enough back and the rear antennae is missing detail, but I’m happy the results are starting to go in the right direction.</p>\n<p>Amazing how quickly the eyes start to deteriorate - the discolouration is caused by the inner layers dehydrating and separating from the outer surfaces. If I find another bee I’ll try a re-shoot while it’s still in pristine condition :)</p>","is_current_item":true,"is_root_item":true}],"image_permalink":"http://reallysmall.tumblr.com/image/6216765275","photos":[{"caption":"","alt_sizes":[{"url":"http://41.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lmbtsai4rZ1qgnzwco1_1280.png","width":800,"height":1195},{"url":"http://41.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lmbtsai4rZ1qgnzwco1_500.png","width":500,"height":747},{"url":"http://41.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lmbtsai4rZ1qgnzwco1_400.png","width":400,"height":598},{"url":"http://40.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lmbtsai4rZ1qgnzwco1_250.png","width":250,"height":373},{"url":"http://41.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lmbtsai4rZ1qgnzwco1_100.png","width":100,"height":149},{"url":"http://41.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lmbtsai4rZ1qgnzwco1_75sq.png","width":75,"height":75}],"original_size":{"url":"http://41.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lmbtsai4rZ1qgnzwco1_1280.png","width":800,"height":1195}}]},{"blog_name":"reallysmall","id":6081396503,"post_url":"http://reallysmall.tumblr.com/post/6081396503/ranitomeya-imitator-this-group-of-dart-frogs-are","slug":"ranitomeya-imitator-this-group-of-dart-frogs-are","type":"photo","date":"2011-06-01 20:37:00 GMT","timestamp":1306960620,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"rDIjxdLq","tags":["posion","dart","frog","thumbnail","photography","macro"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZNs_tx5gUhyN","summary":"Ranitomeya Imitator\r\n This group of dart frogs are often referred to as 'thumbnails' due to their tiny size.

That should fix it because there won’t be any new digits added when it goes from 009 to 010 so it should over-write properly.</li>\n</ul></p>","is_current_item":true,"is_root_item":true}],"video_url":"http://vt.tumblr.com/tumblr_lisfchz2Pw1qgnzwc.mp4","html5_capable":true,"thumbnail_url":"http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lisfchz2Pw1qgnzwc_frame1.jpg","thumbnail_width":"640","thumbnail_height":"480","duration":"131","player":[{"width":250,"embed_code":"\n<video  id='embed-5676791d5ac5e765562933' class='crt-video crt-skin-default' width='250' height='188' poster='http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lisfchz2Pw1qgnzwc_frame1.jpg' preload='none' data-crt-video data-crt-options='{\"autoheight\":null,\"duration\":\"131\",\"hdUrl\":false,\"filmstrip\":false}' >\n    <source src=\"http://api.tumblr.com/video_file/4167864743/tumblr_lisfchz2Pw1qgnzwc\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n</video>\n"},{"width":400,"embed_code":"\n<video  id='embed-5676791d5c2fd768115510' class='crt-video crt-skin-default' width='400' height='300' poster='http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lisfchz2Pw1qgnzwc_frame1.jpg' preload='none' data-crt-video data-crt-options='{\"autoheight\":null,\"duration\":\"131\",\"hdUrl\":false,\"filmstrip\":false}' >\n    <source src=\"http://api.tumblr.com/video_file/4167864743/tumblr_lisfchz2Pw1qgnzwc\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n</video>\n"},{"width":500,"embed_code":"\n<video  id='embed-5676791d5d82e911584211' class='crt-video crt-skin-default' width='500' height='375' poster='http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lisfchz2Pw1qgnzwc_frame1.jpg' preload='none' data-crt-video data-crt-options='{\"autoheight\":null,\"duration\":\"131\",\"hdUrl\":false,\"filmstrip\":false}' >\n    <source src=\"http://api.tumblr.com/video_file/4167864743/tumblr_lisfchz2Pw1qgnzwc\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n</video>\n"}],"video_type":"tumblr"},{"blog_name":"reallysmall","id":4026189522,"post_url":"http://reallysmall.tumblr.com/post/4026189522/mentioned-them-in-the-last-thrilling-update-and","slug":"mentioned-them-in-the-last-thrilling-update-and","type":"video","date":"2011-03-22 17:21:00 GMT","timestamp":1300814460,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"0o4QEhWE","tags":["arduino","rotary encoder","lcd"],"short_url":"http://tmblr.co/ZNs_tx3l_iRI","summary":"Mentioned them in the last thrilling update and here are the new additions:\r\n 16 x 2 serial lcd screen\r\n rotary encoder\r\n The...","recommended_source":null,"recommended_color":null,"highlighted":[],"note_count":12,"caption":"<p>Mentioned them in the last thrilling update and here are the new additions:</p>\n<ul><li>16 x 2 serial lcd screen</li>\n<li>rotary encoder</li>\n</ul><p>The camera isn&rsquo;t hooked up in this video but it&rsquo;s not hard to imagine it going &lsquo;click&rsquo; when the screen says 'Taking picture&rsquo; :)</p>\n<p>Most of the display data on the screen is nice but not really essential.
