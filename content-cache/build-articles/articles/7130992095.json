In some ways it’s quite useful for macro because you can see exactly what your depth of field is - however at higher f stops, the viewfinder will get increasingly dim…fine in daylight, but at dawn or dusk, possibly so dark it’s unusable. I’ll have to see how much of an issue this is, but I’m thinking I can probably live with it.<br />So, did it actually work? From a few tests <strong>(Images 3 &amp; 4)</strong>, it seems to work just fine :)Looking forward to trying it outside….</p>","is_current_item":true,"is_root_item":true}],"photoset_layout":"13","photos":[{"caption":"","alt_sizes":[{"url":"http://40.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lno91ncKJD1qgnzwco1_1280.jpg","width":1024,"height":1120},{"url":"http://41.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lno91ncKJD1qgnzwco1_500.jpg","width":500,"height":547},{"url":"http://41.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lno91ncKJD1qgnzwco1_400.jpg","width":400,"height":438},{"url":"http://36.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lno91ncKJD1qgnzwco1_250.jpg","width":250,"height":273},{"url":"http://40.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lno91ncKJD1qgnzwco1_100.jpg","width":100,"height":109},{"url":"http://41.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lno91ncKJD1qgnzwco1_75sq.jpg","width":75,"height":75}],"original_size":{"url":"http://40.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lno91ncKJD1qgnzwco1_1280.jpg","width":1024,"height":1120},"exif":{"Camera":"HTC Legend","ISO":75,"FocalLength":"3mm"}},{"caption":"","alt_sizes":[{"url":"http://40.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lno91ncKJD1qgnzwco2_1280.jpg","width":1024,"height":945},{"url":"http://36.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lno91ncKJD1qgnzwco2_500.jpg","width":500,"height":461},{"url":"http://40.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lno91ncKJD1qgnzwco2_400.jpg","width":400,"height":369},{"url":"http://40.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lno91ncKJD1qgnzwco2_250.jpg","width":250,"height":231},{"url":"http://41.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lno91ncKJD1qgnzwco2_100.jpg","width":100,"height":92},{"url":"http://40.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lno91ncKJD1qgnzwco2_75sq.jpg","width":75,"height":75}],"original_size":{"url":"http://40.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lno91ncKJD1qgnzwco2_1280.jpg","width":1024,"height":945},"exif":{"Camera":"HTC Legend","ISO":75,"FocalLength":"3mm"}},{"caption":"","alt_sizes":[{"url":"http://41.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lno91ncKJD1qgnzwco3_1280.png","width":1024,"height":685},{"url":"http://41.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lno91ncKJD1qgnzwco3_500.png","width":500,"height":334},{"url":"http://41.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lno91ncKJD1qgnzwco3_400.png","width":400,"height":268},{"url":"http://41.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lno91ncKJD1qgnzwco3_250.png","width":250,"height":167},{"url":"http://40.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lno91ncKJD1qgnzwco3_100.png","width":100,"height":67},{"url":"http://41.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lno91ncKJD1qgnzwco3_75sq.png","width":75,"height":75}],"original_size":{"url":"http://41.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lno91ncKJD1qgnzwco3_1280.png","width":1024,"height":685},"exif":{"Camera":"HTC Legend","ISO":75,"FocalLength":"3mm"}},{"caption":"","alt_sizes":[{"url":"http://41.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lno91ncKJD1qgnzwco4_1280.png","width":1024,"height":696},{"url":"http://41.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lno91ncKJD1qgnzwco4_500.png","width":500,"height":340},{"url":"http://41.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lno91ncKJD1qgnzwco4_400.png","width":400,"height":272},{"url":"http://41.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lno91ncKJD1qgnzwco4_250.png","width":250,"height":170},{"url":"http://41.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lno91ncKJD1qgnzwco4_100.png","width":100,"height":68},{"url":"http://40.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lno91ncKJD1qgnzwco4_75sq.png","width":75,"height":75}],"original_size":{"url":"http://41.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lno91ncKJD1qgnzwco4_1280.png","width":1024,"height":696},"exif":{"Camera":"HTC Legend","ISO":75,"FocalLength":"3mm"}}]}
